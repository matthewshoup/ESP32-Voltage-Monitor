Chat Summary - ESP32 Voltage Monitor

Scope
- Implemented OLED warning, web endpoint, JSONP support, and resilience to missing OLED/WiFi.
- Added a Functional Specification Document (FSD) header to the code.
- Made multiple commits as requested.

Key Changes
- OLED warning when voltage <= 17.0V.
- /voltage GET endpoint returning JSON, JSONP with callback param.
- Program continues if OLED init fails.
- WiFi connect times out after ~10s and continues offline.
- Added FSD block at top of the source file.

Files Updated
- esp32 voltage monitor

Commits Created
- "chatgpt commit" (initial add of file)
- "adding a few checks for wifi and oleds"
- "adding FSD at the top"

Notes
- /voltage is HTTP on port 80. HTTPS would require TLS or a proxy.
- OLED warning and low-voltage cutoff remain separate thresholds.

Update Summary
- Added ASCII wiring diagram comment block.
- Committed and pushed the wiring update on dev.
- Verified main already matched dev.
- Switched between dev and main branches on request.
- Updated gpt_ chat_log.txt with recent actions.
